**Name:**Â uNet Client for ESP32
**Technical Requirements:**

- ESP32 microcontroller with at least 4MB of flash memory and 520KB of SRAM
- uNet client module with optimized data transmission protocols
- HDMI/VGA display driver and input device drivers
- SSL/TLS encryption protocols for secure data transmission

**Working Principle:**  
The uNet Client for ESP32 firmware is designed to establish a remote desktop connection between the ESP32 and the uNet server module. The firmware is optimized to efficiently control the remote instance using the uNet client module and prioritize data transmission based on the user's needs. The firmware is also designed to be highly secure, using SSL/TLS encryption protocols to protect user data.When the ESP32 is turned on, the firmware automatically connects to the uNet server module using the stored credentials and instance information. The firmware then establishes a secure connection using SSL/TLS encryption protocols and begins transmitting data between the remote instance and the ESP32.The firmware is designed to optimize the use of resources on the ESP32, using efficient data transmission protocols and prioritizing data transmission based on the user's needs. The firmware also includes drivers for HDMI/VGA display and input devices, allowing users to interact with the remote instance using a monitor and input devices.**Features:**

- Automatic connection to the uNet server module
- Efficient data transmission protocols for optimized performance
- SSL/TLS encryption protocols for secure data transmission
- HDMI/VGA display driver and input device drivers for user interaction

**Challenges:**

- Optimizing the use of resources on the ESP32 to ensure efficient performance
- Ensuring compatibility with a wide range of remote instances and configurations
- Ensuring the security of user data during transmission
